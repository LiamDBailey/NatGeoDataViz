# NatGeoDataViz
Data visualization on plastic pollution for National Geographic challenge.

This project involves visualisation of data from [Geyer et al. 2017](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/suppl/2017/07/17/3.7.e1700782.DC1/1700782_SM.pdf).

Four separate datasets are extracted and can be found in `inst/extdata`:

## [Global plastic production over time](https://github.com/LiamDBailey/NatGeoDataViz/blob/master/inst/extdata/total_plastic.csv).

Geyer et al. estimated global production of all plastic resins from 1950 - 2015. Production measurements are in million metric tons.

## [Share of polymer resin production in each industrial sector](https://github.com/LiamDBailey/NatGeoDataViz/blob/master/inst/extdata/sectors_plastic.csv).

Proportion of each polymer resin type attributed to different industrial sectors (2000 - 2014). *N.B:* Textiles and plastic micro-fibres are not included.
Plastic micro-fibres are exclusively produced by the textiles industry.

## [Global plastic production and waste in each industrial sector](https://github.com/LiamDBailey/NatGeoDataViz/blob/master/inst/extdata/sectors_waste.csv).

Total amount of plastic produced and plastic waste created from each industrial sector in 2015.

## [Global plastic production and waste for each plastic resin type](https://github.com/LiamDBailey/NatGeoDataViz/blob/master/inst/extdata/plastics_waste.csv).

Total amount of plastic produced and plastic waste created with each plastic resin type in 2015.
